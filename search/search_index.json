Enter a variable that stores an object representing the certificate. Used by Set-AuthenticodeSignature.</li> <li><code>CertificateSubject</code> - Specifies the certificate subject name that will be used to sign scripts. Used by Set-AuthenticodeSignature.</li> <li><code>CertificateThumbprint</code> - Specifies the certificate thumbprint that will be used to sign scripts. Used by Set-AuthenticodeSignature.</li> <li><code>TimestampServer</code>- Uses the specified time stamp server to add a time stamp to the signature. Type the URL of the time stamp server as a string. The URL must start with https:// or http://. Used by Set-AuthenticodeSignature.</li> <li><code>IncludeChain</code> - Determines which certificates in the certificate trust chain are included in the digital signature. NotRoot is the default.
